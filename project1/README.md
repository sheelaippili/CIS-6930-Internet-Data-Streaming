# Internet Data Streaming - Project 1

## Project - Overview

The idea is to implement the 3 hashing techniques - multihashing, cuckoo hashing and DLeft hashing.

## How to run the project

- Download the Project1.java and Project1.class files and place them in a folder. Open terminal in that folder.
- Run the below command to compile the java file.
````
    javac Project1.java
````
- Run the below command to run the executable java file.
````
    java Project1
````
- Select 1 for multihashing, 2 for cuckoo hashing and 3 for Dleft hashing

## Implementation of the hashing techniques

### Multihashing
- This file includes the total number of flow entries that have been filled in the hash table as well as the flowIds that have been entered into which hash table indexes. If any item is 0, it indicates that the flowId was not present in that HashTable index.

### Cuckoo hashing
- The number of flow entries that have been filled in total as well as the flowIds that have been filled in certain hash table indexes are both contained in this file. If any element in the HashTable is 0, it signifies that the flowId was not present in that index.

### dLeft hashing
- In addition to listing which flowIds were filled in which hash table indexes, this file also gives the overall number of flow entries in the hash table that have been filled. The flowId was not present in that HashTable index if any entries are zero.
